Deep learning techniques to improve the quality of old recorded video footage by detecting and removing dirt and other degradations. 

## Introduction

This project explored using deep learning techniques to improve the quality of old recorded video footage by detecting and removing dirt and other degradations. Specifically, it is using convolutional neural network (CNN) and U-Net models against traditional non-deep learning algorithms for dirt removal.

A key challenge with old footage is the large amount of noise and degradation that accumulates over time. Deep learning models like CNNs and U-Nets have shown promise for restoration tasks by learning patterns in data without requiring explicit programming of rules.
